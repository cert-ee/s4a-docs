# Install Detector

## Prerequisites

### Hardware

* CPU - Quad Core Intel i7 CPU or better
* 64Gb RAM
* Solid State Drives (SSD)
* 2+ physical network adapters.

As it is unpredictable in which environment exactly the server will run (it's not only the bandwidth, that matters,
but type of traffic as well). This is a rough estimation, which should be more than sufficient in average environments.
The system requires components and is performing the function which requires utilization of all types of hardware.

### OS

* [Ubuntu 16.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/)

### Networking

Configured Internet connection on one network. No specific rules for ingress traffic are needed.
Egress traffic wise, the detector needs access to the following locations:

* central.example.com tcp/5000 - Central side API endpoint
* tcp/80 and tcp/443 to anywhere - Github for salt states and various apt repositorys to install required packages

### Disk requirements

* **Suricata**
  * For Suricata this depends heavily both on traffic and system settings used - size of the PCAP embedded in event packet, but even
    in modest enviroments and small PCAP length this can be gigabytes in a day.
* **Moloch** / **NFSen**:
  * 1Gbps of network traffic requires ~300GB of disk a day. For example, to store 14 days of 2.5Gbps average traffic you need `14*2.5*300` or ~10TB of disk space.
  * Have at least 3% of disk space available in memory. For example, if the cluster has 7TB of data then `7*0.03` or 210GB of memory is the minimum recommended. Note: the more days stored the memory ratio can actually decrease, to 2% or 1%.
  * Assign half the memory to elasticsearch (but no more then 30G per node) and half the memory to disk cache.
* **Recording PCAP**
  * Example of rough calculation: Link that averages 50Mbps - = 6.25 MB/s = 375 MB/minute = 22,500 MB/hour = 540,000 MB/day.

* Data paths to take into account when partitioning
  * / - Ubuntu 16.04 - **10GB** (about)
  * /srv/elasticsearch
  * /srv/pcap
  * /srv/nfsen
  * /var
  * /log system logs      10GB (start from)
  * /netdata cache        2GB (approx)
  * Detectors MongoDB     1GB (approx)

## Installation process

1. Log in to the server via console or ssh

1. Download and run installation script

    **NB! The below is an example. Ask the person managing the Central you wish to connect to for the correct script.**

        ```bash
        wget https://github.com/cert-ee/s4a/raw/master/scripts/install_detector.sh https://github.com/cert-ee/s4a/raw/master/scripts/install_detector.sh.md5
        md5sum -c install_detector.sh.md5sum
        sudo bash ./install_detector.sh
        ```

1. Installation - console
    * Initial installer script checks for os distribution and version. Mismatch of either of those will not block the installation, but continuing is at the users "own responsibility".
    * Presence of dpkg utility is checked, which is mandatory - only debian packages are supported for now.
    * For early problem detection host and port checks for Deb and Git repos are done.
    * Prerequisite packages will be installed, to complete the installation
    * SaltStack will be installed using [https://bootstrap.saltstack.com](https://bootstrap.saltstack.com)
    * Detector and Nginx states will be applied via SaltStack from CERT-EE git repository.
    * User will be displayed the __web address__ where installation will continue along with __username__ and __password__.

## Problem handling

In case of issues user will see the log and will be provided a possibility to automatically send those to CERT-EE. This is done via standard API and as a result user will receive the registered issue number which user can be used as a referral.

## Installation - webinterface

* Registration: User is asked for general contact information, which is used for identifying and contacting the customer, if necessary.
* Interface selection: System needs at least two interfaces. One for management and the other one(s) for flow capture. It is important **not** to choose management interface at this point, but interface(s) suitable for flow capture as not following this might lock user out of the system.
* Components: Most of the components are listed for informational reasons and canâ€™t be disabled as they are essential for system functions. User can choose between Moloch (professional tool) and NFSen (more lightweight) for flow capture.
* Summary: Before starting the installation, user will be presented with the final configuration.
* Installation: User can observe the installation process, user can see the standard output of the installed components and any errors should they occur
* Final: User will be redirected to the actual/main interface where the  full functionality is activated after Central has approved the registration application.
